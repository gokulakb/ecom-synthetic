I want you to generate synthetic e-commerce dataset CSV files and save them in a folder `data/` inside the workspace. Create 5 files: customers.csv, products.csv, orders.csv, order_items.csv, shipments.csv. Use realistic Customer/Order/Product fields and about: 200 customers, 50 products, 400 orders. Use reasonable dates in the last 3 years. Return only a summary of files created and sample row from each file. Do not modify other files.
